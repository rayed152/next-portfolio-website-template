          Hey There!ðŸ‘‹
          <br /> Iâ€™m Mahmud Rayed, a student of Computer Science at North South
          University in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Iâ€™m on a constant quest for
          knowledge, always eager to explore new ideas and deepen my
          understanding. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and
          technology, where I use code to craft engaging experiences and solve
          complex problems. Whether itâ€™s building sleek interfaces with
          React.js, Next.js, Hugo, and React Native, or diving into the backend
          world with Node.js and databases like MongoDB and MySQL, I love
          bringing ideas to life through software. When it comes to programming
          languages, Iâ€™m a bit of a polyglot! From the flexibility of JavaScript
          to the versatility of Python, and from the robustness of Java to the
          efficiency of C++ and C, I enjoy navigating the diverse landscapes of
          software development. Beyond coding, Iâ€™m a perpetual learner, always
          seeking new ways to innovate and make a positive impact with
          technology. Every project is an opportunity for growth, and I embrace
          challenges as stepping stones to mastery. Join me as we journey
          through the exciting possibilities of the digital realm, one line of
          code at a time. Letâ€™s collaborate, create, and shape the future
          together!
